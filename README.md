# KSP DiscordRP
Discord Rich Presence integration mod for KSP based on [gegy1000/KSP-DiscordRP](https://github.com/gegy1000/KSP-DiscordRP).

Uses [Discord GameSDK](https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide), which is the preferred method for interacting with Discord since the previous DiscordRPC was deprecated.
